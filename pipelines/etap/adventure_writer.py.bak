DATA (use ONLY this data, do NOT invent tours or prices):
{summary}

RULES:
- Write 1,200-1,800 words in English
- Do NOT include any booking links or URLs in the text
- Do NOT invent tour names, prices, or categories not in the data
- Title must include "{city}" and be SEO-friendly
- Required H2 sections:
  ## Why {city} is an Adventure Hotspot
  ## Best Hiking Tours
  ## Extreme Sports and Adrenaline Rushes
  ## Mountain Biking and Cycling Adventures
  ## Best Deals on Adventure Activities
  ## Safety Tips and What to Bring
- For each tour mentioned, include exact name and price from the data
- If a section has no data, skip it gracefully
- Write naturally with engaging prose, not a list dump
- Include practical tips (best time, what to wear, booking advice)
- End with a brief practical summary
- Remove "Save XX%!" prefixes from tour names when mentioning them
- After mentioning 2-3 tours in each section, add a natural CTA like "These tours fill up fast during peak season — check availability and lock in today's price before it changes."
- Do NOT use numbered lists for tours. Weave them into flowing paragraphs
- Include a "Quick Comparison" sentence at the end of each price section (e.g., "At $15, the catamaran tour offers the best value per hour compared to the $50 private option.")
- Make the summary actionable: mention the best overall value pick and the best splurge pick by name and price
